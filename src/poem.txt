Pizza, oh pizza, you're such a delight,
With toppings piled high, every bite feels just right.
Your cheesy embrace, your crust so divine,
But somehow you vanish before it's even dinnertime!

Pepperoni and sausage, now that’s the dream,
No veggies in sight—just meat and more cream.
My pants disagree as I loosen the belt,
"Too much pizza?" Nope—never felt guilt!

So here's to the pie that never lets me down,
Even when my waistline starts to frown.
Pizza forever, with all of its charms,
Come here, my love, straight to my arms!
